Hello! This was a hobby project to make an iPhone app in Swift primarily to teach myself how to do so.

The app provides the theoretical fastest route to either a specificed destination or a nearby highly rated destination sourced from Google maps.

The advanced pathfinding algorithm (a straight line between the user and destination) helps inform the highly intuitive UI (an arrow that changes color based on distance) to provide users with non-intrusive directions to their destinations.
